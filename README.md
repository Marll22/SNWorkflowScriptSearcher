# **Workflow Script Searcher**


I remember going through the community where someone had asked if there was any feature to check for some script in workflow. This utility will allow you search scripts in a specific workflow.


### Installation:

- Install the updateset from the dist folder and it will create a UI page and a script include.
- This utility makes use of JQuery datatable to present the seached information.

### Usage:

- Open the UI page **WorkFlowSearcherUtility** and select the workflow that is required to be searched. 
- Enter the search term and click on **Go**.
